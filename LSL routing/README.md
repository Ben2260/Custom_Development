## Description:
> This script is an example and a usable substitute for connecting any third-party device to the LSL system. This is done through the computer's internal TCP socket protocols. Because of this, we can reroute data into the LSL server and into any other device; more examples of this idea are found in the "Real Time" feature analysis code. However, it is more complicated and may be difficult for those who haven't reviewed multi-processing and the theory behind designing these systems. However, resources for learning more about the basics have been included as links in the above library list.
