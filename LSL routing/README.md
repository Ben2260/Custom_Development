Title:      [M][COM]LSL_Connection.py

Description:
            This script serves as both an example and a usable substitute
            for connecting any third-party device to the LSL system. I've
            done my best to break down each section of the code along with 
            its purpose and included additional resources in the readme 
            file, so please be sure to review it with that file.
